TO DO:
Make it so if the entry_short fails, don't try the rest
Make is so if we find an Email in entry_short or on the others, we don't look further.
Make it possible to add tags from our website
Make it so you can "clean up" the different text files once in a while. To make sure there aren't to many duplicates.
Make A script that sends an Email to all the Emails. Maybe Use the Plugin Isak Found
Make it so you can search on just 1 URL - Mostly For The Future.
Make a new Script that takes Links it finds and then looks for emails and links there and then uses those links etc. etc....
Make it more high coupling - low cohesion.
More methods, less long scripts.
Test if Generators would be faster
Get a better way of identifying Emails, @ is not good enough





DONE THINGS:
DONE - Set up my decorators - Timer(For Test), Log(And Maybe DateTime)
DONE - Make broken links save to another file and then we add those files to the filter check in findEmails.
DONE - Make it so that runScripts takes an array
DONE - Make it so findEmails() accepts the whole file, instead of having to call it multiple times from runScripts. DONE
DONE - Remove Duplicates from Link List. Just make sure it doesnt write but saves it to a list before we write to file.
DONE - Progress bar - see how far the script is.
DONE - Make the Filter actually work!
DONE - Make it so if a link fails it is added to "FilterWords" so we dont waste time on it. Maybe in the future we can run tests to see if the link works again.
