TO DO:
Make it so if the entry_short fails, dont try the rest
Make is so if we find an Email in entry_short or on the others, we dont look further.
Make broken links save to another file and then we add those files to the filter check in findEmails.
Make it possible to add tags from website
Make it so you can "clean up" the different text files once in a while. To make sure there arent to many duplicates.








DONE THINGS

DONE - Make it so that runScripts takes an array
DONE - Make it so findEmails() accepts the whole file, instead of having to call it multiple times from runScripts. DONE
DONE - Remove Duplicates from Link List. Just make sure it doesnt write but saves it to a list before we write to file.
DONE - Progress bar - see how far the script is.
DONE - Make the Filter actually work!
DONE - Make it so if a link fails it is added to "FilterWords" so we dont waste time on it. Maybe in the future we can run tests to see if the link works again.
